# Fifteen puzzle game.

To run the program, run the Fift.py file.

Attention! The program is designed to run on Linux OS,
I have not tested the operation of this program on WINDOWS OS, but I think it should work.

## Required:
To run the program, you need `python3` itself and the installed `PyQt5` module.


## Installing python and PyQt5 module.
**********************************************

### MS Windows: 
For the program to work in MS Windows, you need to use `python` version 3 or higher.
You can download the distribution of `python` from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and double-click the installation

after installation, you need to install the `PyQt5` module
to do this in the console type:
```console
python -m pip install pyqt5
```
the program will download and install the module.
To run this program, you must type in the console
```console
python program_path\Fift.py
```
or
```console
pythonw program_path\Fift.py
```
to run the programm without `terminal`

You can also create a launch shortcut on the desktop

### Linux:
For the program to work in Linux, you need to use `python3`.
Most distributions have python3 preinstalled and you don't need to download and install it, 
you just need to install the `PyQt5` module.
If you do not have python3 installed, you can install it using your package manager, 
for example, in distributions based on Debian, it is installed like this:
```console
sudo apt-get install python3
```
To install the module in the console, type:
```console
pip3 install pyqt5 
```
the module will be automatically downloaded and installed.
The program starts like this:
```console
python3 program_path/Fift.py
```
You can also add permission to run the script and run it by double clicking or create link on Desktop
