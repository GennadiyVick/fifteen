Fifteen puzzle game.

To run the program, run the Fift.py file.

Attention! The program is designed to run on Linux OS,
I have not tested the operation of this program on WINDOWS OS, but I think it should work.

Required:
To run the program, you need python3 itself and the installed PyQt5 module.


Installing python and PyQt5 module.
**********************************************

MS Windows: ============================
You can download the distribution from https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
and double-click the installation

after installation, you need to install the PyQt5 module
to do this in the console type:

python -m pip install pyqt5

the program will download and install the module.
To run this program, you must type in the console

python program_path\Fift.py

You can also create a launch shortcut on the desktop

Linux: ========================
For the program to work in Linux, you need to use python version 3 or higher.
Most distributions have python preinstalled and you don't need to download and install it, 
you just need to install the PyQt5 module.
If you do not have python3 installed, you can install it using your package manager, 
for example, in distributions based on Debian, it is installed like this:

sudo apt-get install python3

To install the module in the console, type: pip3 install pyqt5 
the module will be automatically downloaded and installed.
The program starts like this:

python3 program_path/Fift.py

You can also add permission to run the script and run it by double clicking
