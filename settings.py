'''
   Automove is a game mode where the movement of puzzle pieces
   occurs automatically with animation by pressing the left mouse button
   or keyboard arrows, when the mode is disabled,
   the puzzle pieces must be moved with the mouse, as in a real puzzle.

   I didn't want to include the ability to switch this mode in the menu,
   as it is much easier and faster to complete the puzzle in automove mode.
